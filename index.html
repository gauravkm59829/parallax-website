                Parallax scrolling is one of those web design trends that just keeps on going, and there are sites that use it to brilliant effect. The technique involves designing the background of a website layout to move at a slower rate than the foreground when the user scrolls, creating a 3D-like effect.

                Parallax in web design involves making items and assets on a web page move at a different speed to the rest of the page when a user scrolls through. This provides a 3D effect to elements of the site. Done subtly this type of design can be incredibly effective and build a beautiful user experience.
